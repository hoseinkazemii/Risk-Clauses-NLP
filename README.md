# Automated detection of risky clauses in construction contracts using NLP



Abstract: The construction industry is notorious for its huge cases of disputes. One of the major causes of these disputes is embedded risks in contract clauses that are not detected properly during the construction contract administration (CCA) process. There have been limited models separating risky clauses in construction contracts which are mainly based on hand-crafted rules. However, these models have three significant limitations, namely, time-consuming construction of the initial model, laborious development, and impracticability of extracting all rules. Motivated by this gap, this study proposes an NLP-based model for separating risky clauses in Persian construction contracts. Findings from the study reveal that a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model, named BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), outperforms other deep learning models with an Accuracy and Macro f1-Score of above 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. The model with combined outputs of BiLSTM and CNN and BiLSTM are in the following orders. Another study's experiment demonstrated that using the transfer learning approach can help the enhancement of deep neural network performance in AEC-related studies. This study contributes to the literature by providing an automated tool that can serve as an assistant for the contract reviewing process.
